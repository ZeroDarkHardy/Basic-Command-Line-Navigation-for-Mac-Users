## 1. Introduction to Terminal

**Terminal** is the built-in command-line interface (CLI) on macOS. It allows you to interact with your file system, execute commands, and run scripts.

- You can open Terminal by searching for **"Terminal"** in **Spotlight Search** (Cmd + Spacebar) or navigating to `Applications > Utilities > Terminal`.

---

## 2. Basic Command-Line Syntax
Before diving in, here are some basic rules:
- Commands are typed and executed by pressing `Enter`.
- Directories are similar to "folders" on your computer.
- File paths tell the terminal where a file/directory is located.
- macOS Terminal uses **forward slashes (`/`)** for paths.

### Example:
```bash
/Users/YourName/Documents
```

## 3. Navigating Directories
To work on files, you need to know how to move between directories (folders).

### Check Current Directory
To see where you are:
```bash
pwd
```

### List Contents of a Directory
To list files and folders in the current directory:
```bash
ls
```

### Change Directories
To move into a directory:
```bash
cd folder_name
```

#### Example:
If you are in `/Users/YourName` and want to move to `Documents`:
```bash
cd Documents
```

### Move Up One Level
To go back **one directory**:
```bash
cd ..
```

#### Example:
If you are in `/Users/YourName/Documents` and want to move back to `YourName`:
```bash
cd ..
```

### Navigate to a Specific Path
If you want to move directly to a folder:
```bash
cd /Users/YourName/Documents
```

### Go to the Home Directory
To quickly return to your Home directory:
```bash
cd ~
```

## 4. Creating Files and Directories

### Create a New Directory (Folder)
To create a new directory:
```bash
mkdir new_folder_name
```

#### Example:
```bash
mkdir Projects
```
This will create a folder called `Projects` in your current directory.

### Create a New File
To create an empty file:
```bash
touch new_file.txt
```

#### Example:
To create a file named `example.txt`:
```bash
touch example.txt
```
